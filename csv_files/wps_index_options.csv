tile_bdr,0,"An integer specifying the halo width, in grid points, for each tile of data"
missing_value,no default,"A real value that, when encountered in the data set, should be interpreted as missing data"
scale_factor,1,A real value that data should be scaled by (through multiplication) after being read in as integers from tiles of the data set
row_order,bottom_top,"A character string, either bottom_top or top_bottom, specifying whether the rows of the data set arrays were written proceeding from the lowest-index row to the highest (bottom_top) or from highest to lowest (top_bottom). This keyword may be useful when utilizing some USGS data sets, which are provided in top_bottom order"
