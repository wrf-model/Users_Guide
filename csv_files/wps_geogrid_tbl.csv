NAME,no default,A character string specifying the name that will be assigned to the interpolated field upon output
PRIORITY,no default,"An integer specifying the priority that the data source identified in the table section takes with respect to other sources of data for the same field. If a field has n sources of data, then there must be n separate table entries for the field, each of which must be given a unique value for priority in the range [1, n]"
DEST_TYPE,no default,"A character string, either categorical or continuous, that tells whether the interpolated field from the data source given in the table section is to be treated as a continuous or a categorical field"
INTERP_OPTION,no default,"A sequence of one or more character strings, which are the names of interpolation methods to be used when horizontally interpolating the field. Available interpolation methods are: average_4pt, average_16pt, wt_average_4pt, wt_average_16pt, nearest_neighbor, four_pt, sixteen_pt, search(r), and average_gcell(r). For the search method (search), the optional argument r specifies the maximum search radius in units of grid points in the grid of the source data; the default search radius is 1200 points. For the grid cell average method (average_gcell), the optional argument r specifies the minimum ratio of source data resolution to simulation grid resolution at which the method will be applied; unless specified, r = 0.0, and the option is used for any ratio. When a sequence of two or more methods are given, the methods should be separated by a + sign"
SMOOTH_OPTION,"<null>
(i.e., no smoothing applied)","A character string giving the name of a smoothing method to be applied to the field after interpolation. Available smoothing options are: 1-2-1, smth-desmth, and smth-desmth_special (ARW only)"
SMOOTH_PASSES,1,"If smoothing is to be performed on the interpolated field, smooth_passes specifies an integer number of passes of the smoothing method to apply to the field"
REL_PATH,no default,"A character string specifying the path relative to the path given in the namelist variable geog_data_path. A specification is of the general form RES_STRING:REL_PATH, where RES_STRING is a character string identifying the source or resolution of the data in some unique way and may be specified in the namelist variable geog_data_res, and REL_PATH is a path relative to geog_data_path where the index and data tiles for the data source are found. More than one rel_path specification may be given in a table section if there are multiple sources or resolutions for the data source, just as multiple resolutions may be specified (in a sequence delimited by + symbols) for geog_data_res. See also abs_path"
ABS_PATH,no default,"A character string specifying the absolute path to the index and data tiles for the data source. A specification is of the general form RES_STRING:ABS_PATH, where RES_STRING is a character string identifying the source or resolution of the data in some unique way and may be specified in the namelist variable geog_data_res, and ABS_PATH is the absolute path to the data sourceâ€™s files. More than one abs_path specification may be given in a table section if there are multiple sources or resolutions for the data source, just as multiple resolutions may be specified (in a sequence delimited by + symbols) for geog_data_res. See also rel_path"
OUTPUT_STAGGER,M,"A character string specifying the grid staggering to which the field is to be interpolated. For ARW domains, possible values are U, V, and M; for NMM domains, possible values are HH and VV"
LANDMASK_WATER,"<null>
(i.e., a landmask will not be computed from the field)","One or more comma-separated integer values giving the indices of the categories within the field that represents water. When landmask_water is specified in the table section of a field for which dest_type=categorical, the LANDMASK field will be computed from the field using the specified categories as the water categories. The keywords landmask_water and landmask_land are mutually exclusive"
LANDMASK_LAND,"<null>
(i.e., a landmask will not be computed from the field)","One or more comma-separated integer values giving the indices of the categories within the field that represents land. When landmask_water is specified in the table section of a field for which dest_type=categorical, the LANDMASK field will be computed from the field using the specified categories as the land categories. The keywords landmask_water and landmask_land are mutually exclusive"
MASKED,"<null>
(i.e., a landmask will not be computed from the field)","Either land or water, indicating that the field is not valid at land or water points, respectively. If the masked keyword is used for a field, those grid points that are of the masked type (land or water) will be assigned the value specified by fill_missing"
FILL_MISSING,1.00E+20,A real value used to fill in any missing or masked grid points in the interpolated field
HALT_ON_MISSING,no,"Either yes or no, indicating whether geogrid should halt with a fatal message when a missing value is encountered in the interpolated field"
DOMINANT_CATEGORY,"<null>
(i.e., no dominant category will be computed from the fractional categorical field)","When specified as a character string, the effect is to cause geogrid to compute the dominant category from the fractional categorical field, and to output the dominant category field with the name specified by the value of dominant_category. This option can only be used for fields with dest_type=categorical"
DOMINANT_ONLY,"<null>
(i.e., no dominant category will be computed from the fractional categorical field)","When specified as a character string, the effect is similar to that of the dominant_category keyword: geogrid will compute the dominant category from the fractional categorical field and output the dominant category field with the name specified by the value of dominant_only. Unlike with dominant_category, though, when dominant_only is used, the fractional categorical field will not appear in the geogrid output. This option can only be used for fields with dest_type=categorical"
DF_DX,"<null>
(i.e., no derivative field is computed)","When df_dx is assigned a character string value, the effect is to cause geogrid to compute the directional derivative of the field in the x-direction using a central difference along the interior of the domain, or a one-sided difference at the boundary of the domain; the derivative field will be named according to the character string assigned to the keyword df_dx"
DF_DY,"<null>
(i.e., no derivative field is computed)","When df_dy is assigned a character string value, the effect is to cause geogrid to compute the directional derivative of the field in the y-direction using a central difference along the interior of the domain, or a one-sided difference at the boundary of the domain; the derivative field will be named according to the character string assigned to the keyword df_dy"
Z_DIM_NAME,no default,"For 3-dimensional output fields, a character string giving the name of the vertical dimension, or z-dimension. A continuous field may have multiple levels, and thus be a 3-dimensional field, and a categorical field may take the form of a 3-dimensional field if it is written out as fractional fields for each category"
FLAG_IN_OUTPUT,"<null>
(i.e., no flag will be written for the field)",A character string giving the name of a global attribute which will be assigned a value of 1 and written to the geogrid output
OPTIONAL,no,"Either yes or no, indicating whether the dataset identified by the resolution specified in the geog_data_res namelist option is optional. If an entry in the GEOGRID.TBL file is optional and if the specified resolution of data cannot be read, geogrid will print an informational message indicating that the dataset was not interpolated and continue; otherwise, if the entry is not optional and the specified resolution of data cannot be read, geogrid will halt with an error. It is possible for different priority level entries for the same field to specify different values of the optional keyword, e.g., the priority=2 entry for a field can be optional, while the priority=1 entry can be non-optional (i.e., optional=no)"
