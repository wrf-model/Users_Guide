out_format,‘WPS’,"A character string set either to ‘WPS’, ‘SI’, or ‘MM5’. If set to ‘MM5’, ungrib will write output in the format of the MM5 pregrid program; if set to ‘SI’, ungrib will write output in the format of grib_prep.exe; if set to ‘WPS’, ungrib will write data in the WPS intermediate format"
prefix,‘FILE’,"A character string that will be used as the prefix for intermediate-format files created by ungrib; here, prefix refers to the string PREFIX in the filename PREFIX:YYYY-MM-DD_HH of an intermediate file. The prefix may contain path information, either relative or absolute, in which case the intermediate files will be written in the directory specified. This option may be useful to avoid renaming intermediate files if ungrib is to be run on multiple sources of GRIB data"
add_lvls,.FALSE.,A logical that determines whether ungrib will attemp to vertically interpolate to an additional set of vertical levels specified using the NEW_PLVL and INTERP_TYPE namelist options
interp_type,0,"An integer value specifying the method that ungrib will use when vertically interpolating to new levels. A value of 0 causes ungrib to interpolate linearly in pressure, and a value of 1 causes ungrib to interpolate linearly in log pressure"
new_plvl,no default,"An array of real values that specify the additional vertical levels, given in Pa, to which the ungrib program will attempt to interpolate when ADD_LVLS is true. The set of new levels can be specified explicitly, or, if the levels are evenly spaced in pressure, exactly three values can be specified: the starting pressure, the ending pressure, and the pressure increment. When a starting pressure, ending pressure, and increment are specified, the pressure increment must be a negative number to signal to the ungrib program that this value is not a target pressure level, but rather, an increment to be used between the first and second values"
pmin,100,"A real value specifying the minimum pressure level, in Pa, to be processed from GRIB data. This option applies only to isobaric data sets"
