i_parent_start,no default,"A list of MAX_DOM integers specifying, for each nest, the x-coordinate of the lower-left corner of the nest in the parent unstaggered grid. For the coarsest domain, a value of 1 should be specified"

s_we,1,A list of MAX_DOM integers which should all be set to 1
e_we,no default,"A list of MAX_DOM integers specifying, for each nest, the nest’s full west-east dimension. For nested domains, e_we must be one greater than an integer multiple of the nest’s parent_grid_ratio (i.e., e_we = n*parent_grid_ratio+1 for some positive integer n)"
s_sn,1,A list of MAX_DOM integers which should all be set to 1
e_sn,no default,"A list of MAX_DOM integers specifying, for each nest, the nest’s full south-north dimension. For nested domains, e_sn must be one greater than an integer multiple of the nest’s parent_grid_ratio (i.e., e_sn = n*parent_grid_ratio+1 for some positive integer n)"
geog_data_res,‘default’,"A list of MAX_DOM character strings specifying, for each nest, a corresponding resolution or list of resolutions separated by + symbols of source data to be used when interpolating static terrestrial data to the nest’s grid. For each nest, this string should contain a resolution matching a string preceding a colon in a rel_path or abs_path specification (see the description of GEOGRID.TBL options) in the GEOGRID.TBL file for each field. If a resolution in the string does not match any such string in a rel_path or abs_path specification for a field in GEOGRID.TBL, a default resolution of data for that field, if one is specified, will be used. If multiple resolutions match, the first resolution to match a string in a rel_path or abs_path specification in the GEOGRID.TBL file will be used"
dx,no default,"A real value specifying the grid distance in the x-direction where the map scale factor is 1. For ARW, the grid distance is in meters for the ‘polar’, ‘lambert’, and ‘mercator’ projection, and in degrees longitude for the ‘lat-lon’ projection; for NMM, the grid distance is in degrees longitude. Grid distances for nests are determined recursively based on values specified for parent_grid_ratio and parent_id"
dy,no default,"A real value specifying the nominal grid distance in the y-direction where the map scale factor is 1. For ARW, the grid distance is in meters for the ‘polar’, ‘lambert’, and ‘mercator’ projection, and in degrees latitude for the ‘lat-lon’ projection; for NMM, the grid distance is in degrees latitude. Grid distances for nests are determined recursively based on values specified for parent_grid_ratio and parent_id"
map_proj,lambert,"A character string specifying the projection of the simulation domain. For ARW, accepted projections are ‘lambert’, ‘polar’, ‘mercator’, and ‘lat-lon’; for NMM, a projection of ‘rotated_ll’ must be specified"
ref_lat,no default,"A real value specifying the latitude part of a (latitude, longitude) location whose (i,j) location in the simulation domain is known. For ARW, ref_lat gives the latitude of the center-point of the coarse domain by default (i.e., when ref_x and ref_y are not specified). For NMM, ref_lat always gives the latitude to which the origin is rotated"
ref_lon,no default,"A real value specifying the longitude part of a (latitude, longitude) location whose (i, j) location in the simulation domain is known. For ARW, ref_lon gives the longitude of the center-point of the coarse domain by default (i.e., when ref_x and ref_y are not specified). For NMM, ref_lon always gives the longitude to which the origin is rotated. For both ARW and NMM, west longitudes are negative, and the value of ref_lon should be in the range [-180, 180]"
ref_x,(((E_WE-1.)+1.)/2.) = (E_WE/2.),"A real value specifying the i part of an (i, j) location whose (latitude, longitude) location in the simulation domain is known. The (i, j) location is always given with respect to the mass-staggered grid, whose dimensions are one less than the dimensions of the unstaggered grid"
ref_y,(((E_SN-1.)+1.)/2.) = (E_SN/2.),"A real value specifying the j part of an (i, j) location whose (latitude, longitude) location in the simulation domain is known. The (i, j) location is always given with respect to the mass-staggered grid, whose dimensions are one less than the dimensions of the unstaggered grid"
truelat1,no default,"A real value specifying, for ARW, the first true latitude for the Lambert conformal projection, or the only true latitude for the Mercator and polar stereographic projections. For NMM, truelat1 is ignored"
truelat2,no default,"A real value specifying, for ARW, the second true latitude for the Lambert conformal conic projection. For all other projections, truelat2 is ignored"
stand_lon,no default,"A real value specifying, for ARW, the longitude that is parallel with the y-axis in the Lambert conformal and polar stereographic projections. For the regular latitude-longitude projection, this value gives the rotation about the earth’s geographic poles. For NMM, stand_lon is ignored"
pole_lat,90,"For the latitude-longitude projection for ARW, the latitude of the North Pole with respect to the computational latitude-longitude grid in which -90.0 degrees latitude is at the bottom of a global domain, 90.0 degrees latitude is at the top, and 180.0 degrees longitude is at the center"
pole_lon,0,"For the latitude-longitude projection for ARW, the longitude of the North Pole with respect to the computational lat/lon grid in which -90.0 degrees latitude is at the bottom of a global domain, 90.0 degrees latitude is at the top, and 180.0 degrees longitude is at the center"
geog_data_path,no default,"A character string giving the path, either relative or absolute, to the directory where the geographical data directories may be found. This path is the one to which rel_path specifications in the GEOGRID.TBL file are given in relation to"
opt_geogrid_tbl_path,‘./geogrid/’,"A character string giving the path, either relative or absolute, to the GEOGRID.TBL file. The path should not contain the actual file name, as GEOGRID.TBL is assumed, but should only give the path where this file is located"
