name,no default,"A character string giving the name of the meteorological field to which the containing section of the table pertains. The name should exactly match that of the field as given in the intermediate files (and, thus, the name given in the Vtable used in generating the intermediate files). This field is required"
output,yes,"Either yes or no, indicating whether the field is to be written to the metgrid output files or not"
mandatory,no  ,"Either yes or no, indicating whether the field is required for successful completion of metgrid"
output_name,no default,"A character string giving the name that the interpolated field should be output as. When a value is specified for output_name, the interpolation options from the table section pertaining to the field with the specified name are used. Thus, the effects of specifying output_name are two-fold: The interpolated field is assigned the specified name before being written out, and the interpolation methods are taken from the section pertaining to the field whose name matches the value assigned to the output_name keyword"
from_input,no default,"A character string used to compare against the values in the fg_name namelist variable; if from_input is specified, the containing table section will only be used when the time-varying input source has a filename that contains the value of from_input as a substring. Thus, from_input may be used to specify different interpolation options for the same field, depending on which source of the field is being processed"
output_stagger,M,"The model grid staggering to which the field should be interpolated. For ARW, this must be one of U, V, and M; for NMM, this must be one of HH and VV"
is_u_field,no,"Either yes or no, indicating whether the field is to be used as the wind U-component field. For ARW, the wind U-component field must be interpolated to the U staggering (output_stagger=U); for NMM, the wind U-component field must be interpolated to the V staggering (output_stagger=VV)"
is_v_field,no,"Either yes or no, indicating whether the field is to be used as the wind V-component field. For ARW, the wind V-component field must be interpolated to the V staggering (output_stagger=V); for NMM, the wind V-component field must be interpolated to the V staggering (output_stagger=VV)"
interp_option,nearest_neighbor,"A sequence of one or more character strings, which are the names of interpolation methods to be used when horizontally interpolating the field. Available interpolation methods are: average_4pt, average_16pt, wt_average_4pt, wt_average_16pt, nearest_neighbor, four_pt, sixteen_pt, search(r), and average_gcell(r). For the search method (search), the optional argument r specifies the maximum search radius in units of grid points in the grid of the source data; the default search radius is 1200 points. For the grid cell average method (average_gcell), the optional argument r specifies the minimum ratio of source data resolution to simulation grid resolution at which the method will be applied; unless specified, r = 0.0, and the option is used for any ratio. When a sequence of two or more methods are given, the methods should be separated by a + sign"
interp_mask,no mask,"The name of the field to be used as an interpolation mask, along with the value within that field which signals masked points and an optional relational symbol, < or >. A specification takes the form field(?maskval), where field is the name of the field, ? is an optional relational symbol (< or >), and maskval is a real value. Source data points will not be used in interpolation if the corresponding point in the field field is equal, greater than, or less than, the value of maskval for no relational symbol, a > symbol, or a < symbol, respectively"
interp_land_mask,no mask,"The name of the field to be used as an interpolation mask when interpolating to water points (determined by the static LANDMASK field), along with the value within that field which signals land points and an optional relational symbol, < or >. A specification takes the form field(?maskval), where field is the name of the field, ? is an optional relational symbol (< or >), and maskval is a real value"
interp_water_mask,no mask,"The name of the field to be used as an interpolation mask when interpolating to land points (determined by the static LANDMASK field), along with the value within that field which signals water points and an optional relational symbol, < or >. A specification takes the form field(?maskval), where field is the name of the field, ? is an optional relational symbol (< or >), and maskval is a real value"
fill_missing,1.00E+20,"A real number specifying the value to be assigned to model grid points that received no interpolated value, for example, because of missing or incomplete meteorological data"
z_dim_name,num_metgrid_levels,"For 3-dimensional meteorological fields, a character string giving the name of the vertical dimension to be used for the field on output"
derived,no,"Either yes or no, indicating whether the field is to be derived from other interpolated fields, rather than interpolated from an input field"
fill_lev,no default,"The fill_lev keyword, which may be specified multiple times within a table section, specifies how a level of the field should be filled if that level does not already exist. A generic value for the keyword takes the form DLEVEL:FIELD(SLEVEL), where DLEVEL specifies the level in the field to be filled, FIELD specifies the source field from which to copy levels, and SLEVEL specifies the level within the source field to use. DLEVEL may either be an integer or the string all. FIELD may either be the name of another field, the string const, or the string vertical_index. If FIELD is specified as const, then SLEVEL is a constant value that will be used to fill with; if FIELD is specified as vertical_index, then (SLEVEL) must not be specified, and the value of the vertical index of the source field is used; if DLEVEL is 'all', then all levels from the field specified by the level_template keyword are used to fill the corresponding levels in the field, one at a time"
level_template,no default,A character string giving the name of a field from which a list of vertical levels should be obtained and used as a template. This keyword is used in conjunction with a fill_lev specification that uses all in the DLEVEL part of its specification
masked,"<null> (i.e., the field is valid for both land and water points","Either land, water, or both. Setting MASKED to land or water indicates that the field should not be interpolated to WRF land or water points, respectively; however, setting MASKED to both indicates that the field should be interpolated to WRF land points using only land points in the source data and to WRF water points using only water points in the source data. When a field is masked, or invalid, the static LANDMASK field will be used to determine which model grid points the field should be interpolated to; invalid points will be assigned the value given by the FILL_MISSING keyword. Whether a source data point is land or water is determined by the masks specified using the INTERP_LAND_MASK and INTERP_WATER_MASK options"
missing_value,no default,A real number giving the value in the input field that is assumed to represent missing data
vertical_interp_option,no default,"A character string specifying the vertical interpolation method that should be used when vertically interpolating to missing points. Currently, this option is not implemented"
flag_in_output,"<null> (i.e., no flag will be written for the field)",A character string giving the name of a global attribute which will be assigned a value of 1 and written to the metgrid output if the interpolated field is to be output (output=yes)
