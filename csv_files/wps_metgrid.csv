fg_name,"an empty list
(i.e., no meteorological fields)","A list of character strings specifying the path and prefix of ungribbed data files. The path may be relative or absolute, and the prefix should contain all characters of the filenames up to, but not including, the colon preceding the date. When more than one fg_name is specified, and the same field is found in two or more input sources, the data in the last encountered source will take priority over all preceding sources for that field"
constants_name,"an empty list
(i.e., no meteorological fields)","A list of character strings specifying the path and full filename of ungribbed data files which are time-invariant. The path may be relative or absolute, and the filename should be the complete filename; since the data are assumed to be time-invariant, no date will be appended to the specified filename"
io_form_metgrid,2 (NetCDF),"The WRF I/O API format that the output created by the metgrid program will be written in. Possible options are: 1 for binary; 2 for NetCDF; 3 for GRIB1. When option 1 is given, output files will have a suffix of .int; when option 2 is given, output files will have a suffix of .nc; when option 3 is given, output files will have a suffix of .gr1"
opt_output_from_metgrid_path,"current working directory
(i.e., ./ )","A character string giving the path, either relative or absolute, to the location where output files from metgrid should be written to"
opt_metgrid_tbl_path,‘./metgrid/’,"A character string giving the path, either relative or absolute, to the METGRID.TBL file; the path should not contain the actual file name, as METGRID.TBL is assumed, but should only give the path where this file is located"
process_only_bdy,0,"An integer specifying the number of boundary rows and columns to be processed by metgrid for time periods after the initial time; for the initial time, metgrid will always interpolate to every grid point. Setting this option to the intended value of spec_bdy_width in the WRF namelist.input will speed up processing in metgrid, but it should not be set if interpolated data are needed in the domain interior. If this option is set to zero, metgrid will horizontally interpolate meteorological data to every grid point in the model domains. This option is only available for ARW"
